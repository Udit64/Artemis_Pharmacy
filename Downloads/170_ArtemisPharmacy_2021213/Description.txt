Artemis Pharmacy Store:

We have created a database to enhance accuracy and precision in a medical store where Pharmacists can keep track of all medicines available and its prescription along with the information of their customers(Patients).
In deadline 3, using MySQL, we created ten tables of various entities like the product, employees, customers, etc., and stored the relevant information in the form of its attributes.

We have maintained various integrity constraints like:
	1) Not null: we made necessary attributes like primary keys and others as not null.
	2) Primary Key: Every table has a unique primary key.
	3) Foreign key: We have used concepts of the foreign key in various places, like for storing the list of products a customer buys here customer id and product id are used as a foreign key for referencing each other.
	4) Cascade: We have also handled cases where if we delete or update a foreign key in its main table where it is a primary, then it will edit or delete in all the places where it is used as a foreign key.

Data Population:
We have used https://www.mockaroo.com/ for generating random data, and then, with the help of python, we converted it into the format which mysql allows for insertion.
We have generated a minimum of 150 rows of relevant data for every table, which follows the above-mentioned integrity constraints as well.
